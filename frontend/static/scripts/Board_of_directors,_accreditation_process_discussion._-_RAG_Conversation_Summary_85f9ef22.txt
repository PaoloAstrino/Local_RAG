The Board of Directors plays a key role in data protection and accreditation. Regarding data protection, each division can establish its own cybersecurity policies, within the broader regulatory framework, such as GDPR. The Board also oversees compliance with these regulations, which may involve updates and adherence to public tender requirements.

The Board also impacts the accreditation process, with key components including governance, the EQUIS project leader, and the wider EQUIS team. The accreditation process itself involves creating a Self-Assessment Report, a Data Sheet, and an Online Document Repository, culminating in a Peer Review Visit. This accreditation aims to enhance the visibility and appeal of the organization's programs. The Board ensures these processes are effectively managed and aligned with the organization's strategic goals.
