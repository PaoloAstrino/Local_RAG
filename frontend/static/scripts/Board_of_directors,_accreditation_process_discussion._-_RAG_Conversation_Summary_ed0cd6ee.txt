Hello, today we're discussing the Board of Directors and the accreditation process, specifically in the context of data protection regulations. The Board's components include departmental governance, the EQUIS project leader, the full board, and deputy contact persons from the EQUIS team. A key responsibility of the Board is to oversee and update regulations, particularly those related to personal data protection. The accreditation process involves significant effort, focusing on producing a Self-Assessment Report, a final Data Sheet, and an Online Document Repository. Organization of a Peer Review Visit is also a crucial step. This entire process aims to enhance the visibility and appeal of English-language courses offered. The ultimate goal is to meet regulatory requirements and achieve accreditation.
