The Department operates with four core objectives. Three of these focus on key areas: inclusiveness, sustainability, and fostering critical thinking and creativity. These align with strategies used by teaching secretariats, the business campus, the internship office, and career services. The fourth objective is tied to EQUIS accreditation, a quality assurance standard, and its achievement directly influences and strengthens the other three objectives. Therefore, these four objectives guide the department's actions across its various activities and ensure a commitment to comprehensive excellence.
