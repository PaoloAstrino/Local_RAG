Okay, so these files seem to be a collection of notes or slides focusing on project management, supply chain modeling, and how to make decisions when things are uncertain. They talk about how to define the activities in a project and how they depend on each other. They also cover strategies for collecting data and using critical path analysis. When it comes to supply chains, the notes mention the key elements you need for a good model: objectives, constraints, the decisions you can make, and the data you need. Finally, it touches on things to think about when you're picking a warehouse location, pointing out that it's not just about how far away it is.
